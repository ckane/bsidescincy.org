Stay tuned, the BSides organizing committee decided after 5 years to take a year-long hiatus to better organize planning efforts.

Every single year, we have experienced growth, with the 2018 BSides Cincinnati having been our biggest yet. Due to the participation of all of you, and the generous support of our sponsors, we were able to offer free valet parking to all attendees, a pre-conference day of training from [EC Council](https://eccouncil.org/), and an even better Capture the Flag tournament.

Putting on the 2018 event really stretched our resources, and with many of us having families &amp; full-time jobs, we found ourselves dedicating significant time during the two months prior to the conference just to pull it all together for everyone. We received a considerable amount of feedback, both positive and negative, that we want to incorporate into making the next event even better. However, we've realized that our small rag-tag band of organizers is understaffed for delivering the conference you all deserve.

Because of this, we have decided to take a break from hosting an event in 2019, and instead are going to focus our efforts on formalizing the organization's structure, build plans, and also coordinate smaller outreach efforts to help us build a bigger support staff for hosting the event, as well as improve CFP, activity, and content for the next event.

So, don't fear, BSides Cincinnati isn't going away! Bear with us as we make some much-needed improvements to the organization in order to provide a better future.
