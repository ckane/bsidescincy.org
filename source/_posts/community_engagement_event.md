Hello, Cincinnati-area InfoSec community!

The BSides organizers are looking for you to join the effort to host our next conference, and help lead the future of BSides Cincinnati. Planning for our awesome 2018 event revealed, among other things, that we need to open up the organization to more volunteers from the community - and that we need to better structure our organization.

We felt that hosting a "happy hour" event in the area would be a good opportunity to invite you to join us to discuss opportunities to contribute and learn from the community. So, we will be hosting a happy hour recruiting event at Fretboard Brewing Company, in Blue Ash (north of Cincinnati) on Tuesday April 30th, 2019, from 6:30pm - 9:30pm.

While this is a free event, capacity is limited, so please use the EventBrite link below.
