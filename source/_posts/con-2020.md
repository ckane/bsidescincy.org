BSides Cincinnati is pleased to announce our 2020 conference. The next BSides Cincinnati will be held on **Saturday, Sep 12th 2020**, and we are excited that we will be returning to the [Cincinnati Union Terminal Museum Center](https://www.cincymuseum.org/union-terminal/), which underwent a multi-year renovation shortly after the last time we held the conference at this venue. This iconic art-deco building is located in the heart of Cincinnati's industrial basin, and today houses the region's only Amtrak station as well as three museums and event spaces.

The planning committee is working hard to put together the best BSides Cincinnati yet. We are committed to bringing tougher CTF challenges, as well as another great list of speakers from the region and the InfoSec community. Keep checking back with us, and follow [our Twitter account](https://twitter.com/bsidescincy/). We plan to open up CFP in early 2020, and will have more announcements as that time approaches.

Thank you everyone for being patient during our reorganization in 2019. Looking forward to 2020 to bring you a great conference, and many more after that!
