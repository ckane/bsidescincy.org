The COVID-19 crisis has changed life considerably for many of us over the year. In March, when the quarantines began, our organizing committee began discussing what actions we should take and whether we should consider postponing the conference. After some discussion, as well as revisions to our event contracts, we have elected to reschedule the event for:

* **Saturday September 25th, 2021**

It is estimated that there will not be widespread vaccinations available until early 2021. Additionally, it has always been our goal for this conference to foster a lot of one-on-one interaction among members of the local infosec community. We cannot, in good conscience, advocate for this in the current conditions. We want to hold a safe & inclusive conference for all. Since March, many other regional information security conferences have either canceled, or converted to an online format. [Even DEF CON has been canceled this year](https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-safemode/dc-safemode-faq.html). We will continue planning the same great conference, reviewing the CFP submissions thus far, keeping CFP submissions open into 2021, and continuing to advertise the conference. 

We still plan on holding a CTF, and as well will be continuing discussions to offer other events during or adjacent to the conference. The [volunteer registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdH2snmkPbOwJr78ayZeQgvUbi5QF4Fs7QdKeMcrIVBBzL-RQ/viewform) is still up, and we are still accepting volunteer registrations. Do not fear if you do not receive a response right away - many of us have become busier than normal due to the unprecedented events of this year. Rest assured that we will reach out.
