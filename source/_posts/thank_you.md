The BSides Cincinnati board would like to extend a huge *Thank You* to everyone who came out to our event in April, and especially to those of you who volunteered to help us organize our 2020 conference. The board has spent much of the month of May combing through the submissions, identifying the organizing teams, and working with our to-be-announced conference director. We recognize many of you haven't heard back from us, but rest assured that you will be hearing from us in the coming weeks. We will be planning another small event to bring us all together again, in order to kick off the 2020 conference planning.

We are still actively accepting volunteers, and have re-opened the volunteer submission form. We will keep this open for the duration of the planning process:

Thanks again for all you do!
